#ember-calendar
================

A great ember (js) calendar module as a component

## Installation

In order to make this work you have to:
	
	Import ember-calendar.js 
	Import calendar_helper.js
	Import kalendar.css (for styling)
	Import ember-calendar_template (or just creating one as in the example app)
	
After initializing the Ember Application you have to set the component into your application. This is accomplished by simply adding the following line after importing the previous files and after you create your app. 
	
	ExampleApp.EmberCalendar = Ember.EmberCalendarComponent;
	
## To do list

There are a lot of things to add yet. Many of them are written on the ember-calendar.js file. But mainly:

	Add configuration options
	Create gulp/grunt/broccoli/rails_gem/other installator
